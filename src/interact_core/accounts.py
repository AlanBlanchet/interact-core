"""The wire's complete failure vocabulary, and the single source the server's own raisable set
binds to (`interact_server.errors.ErrorCode`) — a code can never reach a client without being
in the contract that client's types are generated from. `link_expired`: a one-time link the
caller presented is gone (expired, already consumed, or never issued), which no retry of the
same link can fix — distinct from `authentication_failed`, where the CREDENTIAL was wrong and
retrying is exactly the right move. `last_sign_in_method`: disconnecting a linked Google
identity was refused because the account has no password and this is its last one — the only
door out, so it is never removed silently. `not_linked`: the email named in a disconnect
request is not one of the caller's own linked Google identities."""
